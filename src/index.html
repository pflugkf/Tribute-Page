    <h3 id="tagline">Here is a timeline of Takahata-san's life:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>1935</strong> - Isao Takahata is born in Ujiyamada (Ise), Mie Prefecture, Japan. He is the youngest of seven siblings.</li>
      <li><strong>1945</strong> - Takahata and his family survive a major US air raid on Okayama City. His experiences during this time would later act as inspiration for several sequences in his antiwar film, <em>Grave of the Fireflies</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>1959</strong> - Takahata graduates from the University of Tokyo with a degree in French literature and joins Toei Animation.</li>
      <li><strong>1968</strong> - Takahata directs his first animated feature film, <em>The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun</em>, with Hayao Miyazaki as lead animator. The two become close friends.</li>
      <li><strong>1985</strong> -  Miyazaki and Takahata co-found their own animation studio, Studio Ghibli. The name is inspired by the Italian term <em>ghibli</em>, adapted from the Arabic word for the hot desert winds. Miyazaki hoped that their new studio would "blow a new wind through the anime industry."</li>
      <li><strong>1988</strong> - Takahata's first Ghibli film, <em>Grave of the Fireflies</em>, is released alongside Miyazaki's <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em>. Both films receive critical acclaim, and the loveable Totoro becomes Studio Ghibli's mascot.</li>
      <li><strong>1991</strong> - <em>Only Yesterday</em> is released in theaters. The movie follows an officeworker reminiscing about her childhood as she takes a trip back to her rural hometown. An English-language version is not released until its 25th anniversary in 2016, leading some fans to refer to it as the "lost" Ghibli film.</li>
      <li><strong>1994</strong> - <em>Pom Poko</em> is released in theaters. It tells the story of a group of mythical creatures called tanuki trying to save their forest home from urban development.</li>
      <li><strong>1999</strong> - <em>My Neighbors the Yamadas</em>, a film adaptation of a popular Japanese comic strip, is released in theaters. A critical and commercial failure, Takahata decides to take on a more behind-the-scenes role at Studio Ghibli for a time.</li>
      <li><strong>2013</strong> - Takahata's last film, <em>The Tale of Princess Kaguya</em>, is released. Based on a classic Japanese folktale, it was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 87th Academy Awards.</li>
      <li><strong>2018</strong> - Takahata dies of lung cancer on April 5th at a hospital in Tokyo. He was 82.</li>
